## Prerequisites and Requirements

To complete this lesson, you will need a Mac, Windows, or Linux computer and the ability to download and install some free, open-source software on your local machine. The tutorial will use Visual Studio Code as a text editor, but you are welcome to work with any text editor of your choice. You can follow the links below to read CollectionBuilder's documentation for detailed help with the installation process for each piece of software:

- [Install Git](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/software/git/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [Install GitHub Desktop](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/software/git/#install-github-desktop){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [Install Visual Studio Code](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/software/texteditor/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [Install Ruby](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/software/ruby/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [Install Jekyll](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/software/jekyll/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- [Install ImageMagick and Ghostscript](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/software/optional/#imagemagick-and-ghostscript){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

In this lesson, you will start with a copy of the [cb_essay_ohd repository](https://github.com/aweymo-ui/cb_essay_ohd){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} which runs this [live site](https://aweymo-ui.github.io/cb_essay_ohd/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and you will finish with a repository that looks similar to the [Chestnut Collective repository](https://github.com/thecdil/chestnutcollective){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} which runs this [live site](https://thecdil.github.io/chestnutcollective/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

## How Difficult is this Lesson?

While some familiarity with Jekyll and static web development would be beneficial, the steps in this tutorial are meant to be clear and easy to follow for beginners with minimal coding experience. You will gain familiarity with the GitHub.com interface, Visual Studio Code, CollectionBuilder, and Oral History as Data. The only use of the command line will be to generate object derivatives using a rake task.

There are screenshots and GIFs to help you double check your work and as your progress through the tutorial. The "Help" section at the bottom also includes links to further reading, as well as suggested tutorials, community groups, and documentation for continued learning.

## The 'Chestnut Collective'

The 'Chestnut Collective,' which was originally coined during an interview with Savannah Clark, is a multidisciplinary, digital exhibition of the entangled ways in which humans and more-than-human species are intrinsically interlinked. The main, overarching question driving the entire investigation is trying to uncover the sociocultural and sociopolitical implications of the Chestnut Blight and subsequent loss of the American Chestnut on Appalachian families and communities.
